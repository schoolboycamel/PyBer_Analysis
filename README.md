# PyBer_Analysis
Analyze Pyber's rideshare data with Python
#Overview 
Purpose of the project is to analyze and visualize rideshare data for PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion, in order to help imorove their ride-sharing services and determine affordability for undeserved neighborhoods. 
# Results

We can appreciate a statistical overview that essentially summarizes PyBer's ride-sharing date. 
Rural cities have the least demand, and as well as the least supplt of drivers as the average number of drivers in rural cities is nine to four times less per city than in urban and suburban cities. However, their average cost per ride, and driver is substantially higher.

From this combined box-and-whisker plots, we can understand that the avg fare for rides in the rural cities is higher than the avg cost per ride in suburban and urban areas.  The reason may be because there is not enough supply for the demand in the given rural areas

# As a result, we can understand that:
1. Urban areas has the highets demand and supply amongst all three city types 
2. Rural areas have a higher fare cost, as well as a higher driver count 
3. Recommendations include hiring more drivers in order to meet rural rider demand. This may be beacause distances may prolongate ride time, thus less available drivers.
